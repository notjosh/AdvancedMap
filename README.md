# AdvancedMap

[Lilu][1] plugin for enabling modern maps on non-Apple Silicon hardware.

Advanced maps were added in macOS 12 Monterey, and worked fine on Intel hardware in the early betas. Later betas blocked the support. I suspect Apple aren't fully testing it on Intel, so perhaps not all hardware is supported, but it works well for me.
